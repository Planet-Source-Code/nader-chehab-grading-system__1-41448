### Description

The Grading System helps maintain and organize a secure and dynamic database in an educational institution. This program was mainly a project for my VB class. I'd like anyone to give their opinions/ideas/advice on this program.
 
### More Info
 
Student information, teacher information, course information, grades etc.

The program includes an option to send a report to Excel. You must have Excel to use this option.

An organized database that you can view/edit through the Grading System program.

the program registers in the win.ini.

However, it has an uninstaller that take

care of unregistering in case you need to.
